# Battery Charge Checker

As you can read in [this very official looking PDF](https://nems.nih.gov/Documents/Newsletter/2022/10_October_2022/Laptop_Plug_Vs_Battery.pdf), leaving your laptop plugged in all the time is bad for your battery's lifespan. When your battery starts running low, your operating system will make sure to remind you, but nobody reminds you when your battery is full. 

This will remind you to unplug your laptop when it's fully charged.
